# ContextGuard

🛡️ **Don't let misinformation win the narrative.**

**[→ Live demo: https://contextguard-frontend-477107377254.asia-southeast1.run.app/](https://contextguard-frontend-477107377254.asia-southeast1.run.app/)**

ContextGuard is an AI-assisted credibility and fact-checking system. This repository is the **forum-based website**: a Next.js app for discovering suspicious claims, submitting reports, and browsing community discussions—with optional integration to the ContextGuard browser extension for in-page verification and reporting.

## Related repositories

ContextGuard is split across three repositories:

| Repo | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🔌 **[ContextGuard Web Extension](https://github.com/JunJin1218/ContextGuard-WebExtension)** | Browser extension (WXT + Svelte) for inline Google Search verification badges and a popup credibility review. Supports login via this website and links to report suspicious content here. |
| ⚙️ **[ContextGuard Web Extension Backend](https://github.com/JunJin1218/natfanclub-backend)** | FastAPI backend that powers the extension: crawling, summarization, and OpenAI-based verification (`/verify_content`, `/domain_verify`, `/crawl`). |
| 🌐 **This repo (ContextGuard Website)** | Next.js forum-style website: landing, report submission, listing/detail pages, auth, and API used by the extension (e.g. chat report flow). |

---

## Extension in brief

The **ContextGuard Web Extension** adds credibility signals where you browse:

- 🔍 Injects verification badges on Google Search results (e.g. Likely Accurate, Unverified, Potentially Misleading).
- 📋 Popup provides a detailed credibility review (crawl → summarize → verify) with supporting/contradicting sources.
- 🔗 Users can sign in with this website and use “Report” links to submit suspicious pages into the forum workflow below.

This website is the **forum and report hub**: you browse trending claims, open report details, and submit new reports—with or without the extension.

---

## Website features

- **Landing** – Tagline, “Verify a Claim” CTA, and trending/popular unverified claims by category.
- **Report** – Submit suspicious content (URL, headline, platform, reason, evidence); supports authenticated and extension-origin reports.
- **Forum / Listing** – Browse claims by category, view post detail with AI summary, reports, and threaded comments.
- **Auth** – Register, log in, profile (view/edit), and change password.
- **API** – REST API for posts, categories, reports, auth, and internal endpoints (e.g. extension chat report).
